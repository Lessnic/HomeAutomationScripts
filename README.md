# Home Automation Scripts

:information_source: It isn't a ready to compile/go project, just a published for the community dozen of examples to keep/fix/manage all of them in one place instead of tens of forums.

Home automation scripts examples pack for [Domoticz](https://domoticz.com/) system.

Lua, PowerShell, Bash, Python, but mostly [dzVents](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/DzVents:_next_generation_LUA_scripting) had been used here.
